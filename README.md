# Test_Repo

This program creates a list of cars for used and new car dealerships, vendors, and manufacturers. 
This solves inventory control, by accepting input information of cars, and storing them inside of list for inventory access, and stock management.

I didn't do particularly well considering I couldn't run my code and debug logic errors for the following reasons:
    -Something is wrong with my C++ configuration on my computer
    -Virtual Lab for this course has signed me out and isn't letting sign back in. Didn't reach out to IT because of deadline reasons when course ends.
    
I plan to enhance my code, to be able to add, remove, modify car inventory, add details such as car history, features, and Car information section using Dynamic Arrays with pointers. I also would like to add an inventory organizing system to filter cars most sold, and number of days in inventory.

Skills in this program will be pointers and inventory and item management, which is used everywhere to keep track of information with storing and retrieving.

I made it maintainable with comments, and using variables for easy reading, and adaptable with organizing files, variables, and functions with modularization.
